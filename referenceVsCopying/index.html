    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age=100;
    // let age2=age;
    // console.log(age,age2);
    // age=200;
    // console.log(age,age2);
    // let name ='wes';
    // let name2='wes';
    // console.log(name,name2);
    // name='wesley';
    // console.log(name,name2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team =players;        //reference to the array
    console.log(team,players);
    

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3]='Lux'; 
    // console.log(team,players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    const team2 = players.slice();  //copy the array
    //or we can use 
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    //or we can use
            //best way for me
    //or we can use 
    const team5= Array.from(players);

    team2[3]='Lux';
    console.log(team2,players);


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; 

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 90;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person, {age:99});
                            // empty obj then the one we wantot copy and then the property we want to change

    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3= {...person};
    cap3.age=99;
    console.log(cap3,person);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
